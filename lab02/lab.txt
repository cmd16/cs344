2.1
  a. Hill-climbing and simulated annealing solve the problem perfectly.
  b. Hill-climbing is faster.
  c. The starting value for x does not stop either algorithm from finding the solution, but it does make hill-climbing
     slower.
  d. If the delta is too high, it is possible to miss the correct answer because you won't step all the way to the solution (hill-climbing)
     or you don't stay on the solution (simulated annealing).
  e. exp_schedule is setting up the temperature that decreases over time

2.2
  a. Hill-climbing finds the closest local maximum. Sometimes simulated annealing sometimes finds a local maximum,
     sometimes it finds a global maximum
  b. Yes. Hill-climbing (and to some extent simulated annealing) find the local maximum close to the starting value
  c. With a higher step size, hill-climbing gets closer to the solution (that it would with a lower delta) if it starts near 0,
     but it is more likely to stay at the initial value if the initial value is high. Simulated annealing gets closer
     to the solution but is also more likely to go out of bounds (I still haven't figured out how to tell it it must be
     between 0 and 30).
  d. Minimum 0, maximum 30. Simulated annealing does better.
