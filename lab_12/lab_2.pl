/**
Exercise 2.1, questions 1, 2, 8, 9, 14 - Give the necessary instantiations.

1. bread  =  bread
unifies

2. ’Bread’  =  bread
does not unify.

8. food(X)  =  food(bread)
unifies. necessary instantiation: food(X)  =  food(bread).

9. food(bread,X)  =  food(Y,sausage)
unifies. necessary instantiations: X = sausage, Y = bread.

14. meal(food(bread),X)  =  meal(X,drink(beer))
does not unify.

Exercise 2.2 - Explain how Prolog does its unification and reasoning. If you have issues getting the results you’d expect, are there things you can do to game the system?
