a.
  1. cities['large_with_saint'] = (cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San')) & cities['Area square miles'] > 50)
  2. Indexes are usually pulled from the data. Sometimes you may want to make sure a certain set of indexes is included
     (for example, days of the year), even if not every index has data in the dataset for it. That way you don't have to
     worry about sanitizing the input.

b. Numpy is good at manipulating data, but Pandas is better at reading in, storing, and modifying datasets. In most cases,
   you would want to use Pandas and Numpy in combination

c. When you want a random subset of the data, either because the data is too large to work with all of it,
   or because you want to break the data into a train/test split. Or when you want to use some algorithm that
   cares about order (e.g., something like hill-climbing), you might do this because you don't want the algorithm to get
   distracted by other things.
