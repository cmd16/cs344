Task #1 — What are the biases present in the given dataset?

Gender bias: more men than women represented (and more husbands than wives).
High percentage of 0s in capital_gain and capital_loss (might be ok, but merits further review).
Unclear how hours_per_week is stored. Minimum is 1 (which would not be enough for most jobs)
and maximum is 99 (which is technically possible but seems very unlikely).

Task #2 — Assess the potential bias in some other feature besides education level.

I looked at hours per week on the x-axis and gender as the color/label. It looks like the
majority of the distribution of hours per week falls within the 40-50 hour range, but there are still people on either side of that peak
(more weight on the 0-40 side than the 50-100 side though). There are very few women working more than 50 hours a week, and in each bin
with less than 40 hours per week, women are the majority. This might seem reasonable for 1994, but it could be that working women are
underrepresented in this data. After all, we do know women are underrepresented in general. Interestingly, there are not many people at all in the
0-10 bin, so unemployed people may be underrepresented in this dataset.

Task #3 — Do as written.

Task #4 — Do you find disparities when you look at race rather than gender? If so, which way to they skew?

White:              Precision 0.7084, Recall 0.5526, False Positive Rate 0.0798
Black:              Precision 0.6486, Recall 0.4286, False Positive Rate 0.0314

Asian-Pac-Islander: Precision 0.7100, Recall 0.5868, False Positive Rate 0.1010
Amer-Indian-Eskimo: Precision 0.7273, Recall 0.4211, False Positive Rate 0.0231
Other:              Precision 0.7000, Recall 0.2917, False Positive Rate 0.0306

First I should note the majority of the people in the data were white. There were some black people,
but not many people in the other race categories. We can see that the recall and false positive rate are highest for white people
(with the exception of Asian-Pac-Islander, which had higher recall). So the model is more likely to predict a high income for
a white person than for a person of another race. (Unsurprising, since this matches the data the model was fed.) The model has
the worst precision for black people.

If recall is the most important metric, the disparities skew in favor of white people. If false positive rate is the most important metric,
the disparities skew against white people.
