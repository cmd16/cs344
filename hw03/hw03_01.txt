Compute the information gain provided by the “price“ attribute from the restaurant domain.
Use this restaurant data (AIMA, Figure 18.3). Would this question be better than either of the questions discussed in
class (i.e., “Patrons?”, “Type?”?

p is number of positive examples, n is number of negative examples

p_k and n_k are number of positive and negative examples in subset E_k of the training set E

B(q) is the entropy of a Boolean random variable that is true with probability q:
B(q) = -(q log_2(q) + (1-q) log_2(1-q))

Remainder (A) = sum(k=1, to=d, (p_k + n_k)/ (p + n) B(p_k / (p_k + n_k)))

Gain(A) = B(p/(p+n)) − Remainder(A)

For this particular domain, B(p/(p+n)) = 1


Gain(Patrons) = 1 - [2/12 B(0/2) + 4/12 B(4/4) + 6/12 B(2/6)] = 0.541 bits
Gain(Type) = 1 - [2/12 B(1/2) + 2/12 B(1/2) + 4/12 B(2/4)] = 0 bits

Price
$:   2,3,4,7,9,11,12 (2,3,4,12 will wait)
$$:  6,8 (6,8 will wait)
$$$: 1,5,10 (1 will wait)

Gain(Price) = 1 - [7/12 B(4/7) + 2/12 B(2/2) + 3/12 B(1/3)] = 1 - [7/12 (0.9852) + 2/12 (0) + 3/12 (0.9183)] = 0.195725

This question would not be better than Patrons, but it would be better than Type.
