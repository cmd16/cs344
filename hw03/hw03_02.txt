In class, we attempted to create by hand a neural network that computes the XOR function.
If this was possible, see if you can simplify the network we built. Consider relaxing the conventions of densely-connected, sequential layers.
If it was not possible, give a full explanation why it canâ€™t be done.

You gave the diagram of the neural network we built in class. I tried to look at simplifying it, but I realized I'm still lost.
I kind of get how the network works, but I don't know how to simplify it. And I don't know how I could relax
the conventions of densely-connected, sequential layers in such a way that it's still a network. Maybe I don't understand well enough what a network is.
