In class, we attempted to create by hand a neural network that computes the XOR function.
If this was possible, see if you can simplify the network we built. Consider relaxing the conventions of densely-connected, sequential layers.
If it was not possible, give a full explanation why it canâ€™t be done.

I couldn't figure out where in class we did this so I didn't have the reference necessary to complete this question.
I tried to ask you in Microsoft Teams on Monday but you never responded.
