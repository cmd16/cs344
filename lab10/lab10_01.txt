Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?

I find Keras easier to use, TensorFlow seems more complicated with more manual steps.


Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.

learning_rate=0.001,
steps=2000,
batch_size=100,
hidden_units=[10, 10]

116.83 RMSE on the testing dataset (with my first attempt)
