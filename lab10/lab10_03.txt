Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?

The confusion matrix compares predicted digits (from the model) with true digits (from the data) and quantifies how the categories match up.
In this example, I can see the model confuses certain pairs of digits (5 and 8, 4 and 9, 7 and 9, 5 and 3).
It's hard to tell with the color scale of the graph, but these confusions seem to be roughly symmetric
(e.g., predicted 3 but true 5 with 0.2 probability, predicted 5 but true 3 with 0.2 probability).

Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.

I was not able to make any improvements over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.

Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?

It's a little easier to see defined shapes in the 1000 steps version. For example, I see some things that look like 5 and some things that look like 8.
that makes sense given that 5 and 8 are numbers that can be difficult to distinguish.
