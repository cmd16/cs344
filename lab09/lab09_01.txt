a. Linear regression is not very effective. The RMSE barely changes over all the periods; the model isn't learning
it's just making slight variations on one mediocre solution.

b. LogLoss takes probability/confidence into consideration. If you predicted the wrong answer with 0.999 confidence,
you are penalized more than if you predicted the wrong answer with 0.9 confidence. L2Loss doesn't pay as much attention to
probability/confidence.

c. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression actually learns. LogLoss consistently goes down with more periods.

d. AUC: 0.81,
   learning_rate=0.000005, steps=20000, batch_size=500
